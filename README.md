# IT-women-in-society-2015-20
This folder contains an XLS file with female percentages (2015-20, Italy) for 26 professions/political roles. Their names were studied for gender stereotypes in Italian news using Word Embeddings of occupational and political titles.
The sources are diverse because, during the period when the study was conducted, and still today, a single database reporting the percentages or absolute numbers of women and men in various professions or political positions does not exist in Italy or specifically related to the Italian context.
